# questionnaire-project
project to create qeustions and custom questionnaires

## Overview
Basic CRUD questionnaire-app built with React, Node, Postgres with basic node-pg SQL-querys. 

I used this project to get more familiar with creating basic CRUD applications and Modeling relational Data while improving my react abilitys. 
I realized,  that especially keeping frontend with backend data in sync is a really hard problem and I should probably have used a library like react-query to tackle the problem.

## Starting
User one of the docker-compose files with Docker to start the project
