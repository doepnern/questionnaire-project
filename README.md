# questionnaire-project
project to create qeustions and custom questionnaires

## Overview
Basic CRUD questionnaire-app built with React, Node, Postgres with basic node-pg SQL-querys. 

I used this project to get more familiar with creating basic CRUD applications and Modeling relational Data. 
Especially keeping fontend UI in sync with backend data was a big challange to me, I should have made use of tools like react-query in hindsight.

## Starting
User one of the docker-compose files with Docker to start the project.
